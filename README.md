# FastReliableFileTransfer
Built an IP based fast file transfer utility (similar to scp) for transferring files on a lossy link with long delays. Developed the file transfer system on DETER testbed using UDP sockets. Higher throughput than FTP, with reliable file transfer was achieved, in this restricted setting. Used SHA1 (hashing) to ensure integrity.
